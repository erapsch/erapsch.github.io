## Welcome!

I am a mathematician and active <a href="/research">**researcher**</a> in 
* Game and decision theory,
* Stochastic control theory,
* Financial mathematics, and
* Environmental economics.

I am a PhD candidate in Mathematics at TU Berlin, supervised by <a href="https://stochasticcontrol.org/">Prof Dr Christoph Knochenhauer</a>. Before, I have studied in Oxford, Berlin, Lyon, and Freiburg. I obtained my MSc degree in Lyon (ENS).

Currently, I am employed in the group "Stochastik und Finanzmathematik", under <a href="https://www3.math.tu-berlin.de/stoch/wp_bank/">Prof Dr Peter Bank</a>, at TU Berlin. Moreover, I am affiliated with the <a href="https://www3.math.tu-berlin.de/stoch/IRTG/">Berlin-Oxford International Research Training Group 2544 "Stochastic Analysis in Interaction"</a>.

The second main pillar of my academic activity is <a href="/teaching">**teaching**</a>. I have taught mainly in courses on Probability Theory, Financial Mathematics and Analysis, mostly for pure Mathematics programmes, but also for Business Mathematics and Engineering programmes.
