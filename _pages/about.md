## Welcome!

I am a mathematician (PhD) trained in stochastic analysis and control, game and decision theory, financial mathematics, and environmental economics. I have gained professional experience in both research and teaching through my position in the Stochastics and Financial Mathematics group at Technische Universität (TU) Berlin, under <a href="https://www3.math.tu-berlin.de/stoch/wp_bank/">Professor Dr. Peter Bank</a> since 2023, and before that under <a href="https://www.stochasticcontrol.org">Professor Dr. Christoph Knochenhauer</a>. Backed by my academic experience at TU Berlin, University of Oxford, ENS de Lyon, and Uni Freiburg, I combine rigorous theoretical expertise with practical applications in finance, economics, and policy making. 
<!--Experienced in team work, leadership, and management, I am interested in leveraging mathematics and game theory to understand and solve complex strategic problems and to support better decision making in economics, finance, and beyond.-->

I obtained the degree <em>Dr. rer. nat.</em> in Mathematics at Technische Universität Berlin and within the <a href="https://www3.math.tu-berlin.de/stoch/IRTG/">Berlin-Oxford International Research Training Group 2544 "Stochastic Analysis in Interaction"</a>, a certified unit of the <a href="https://www.math-berlin.de/">Berlin Mathematical School</a>, and advised by <a href="https://www.stochasticcontrol.org">Professor Dr. Christoph Knochenhauer</a>. Before this, I have studied in Oxford, Berlin, Lyon (ENS), and Freiburg, and obtained the degree <em>Master of Science</em> in Mathematics in Lyon.

The second main pillar of my academic activity has been <a href="/teaching">**teaching**</a>. I have taught mainly in courses on Probability Theory, Financial Mathematics, and Analysis, mostly for pure Mathematics programmes, but also for Business Mathematics and Engineering programmes.
