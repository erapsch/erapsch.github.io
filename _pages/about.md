## Welcome!

I am a mathematician. My <a href="/research">**research**</a> interests include 
* Game and decision theory,
* Stochastic control theory,
* Financial mathematics, and
* Environmental economics.

I have successfully completed the procedure for obtaining the degree <em>Dr. rer. nat.</em> in Mathematics at Technische Universität Berlin. Before this, I have studied in Oxford, Berlin, Lyon (ENS), and Freiburg. I obtained the degree <em>Master of Science</em> in Mathematics in Lyon.

Currently, I am employed in the group "Stochastik und Finanzmathematik", led by <a href="https://www3.math.tu-berlin.de/stoch/wp_bank/">Professor Dr Peter Bank</a>, at TU Berlin. During my PhD studies, I have been affiliated with the <a href="https://www3.math.tu-berlin.de/stoch/IRTG/">Berlin-Oxford International Research Training Group 2544 "Stochastic Analysis in Interaction"</a>, a certified unit of the <a href="https://www.math-berlin.de/">Berlin Mathematical School</a>.

The second main pillar of my academic activity is <a href="/teaching">**teaching**</a>. I have taught mainly in courses on Probability Theory, Financial Mathematics, and Analysis, mostly for pure Mathematics programmes, but also for Business Mathematics and Engineering programmes.
