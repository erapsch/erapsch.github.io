## Welcome!

I am a mathematician, PhD with 6+ years of professional experience, lastly at TU Berlin under <a href="https://www3.math.tu-berlin.de/stoch/wp_bank/">Professor Dr. Peter Bank</a>. Trained at TU Berlin, Univ. of Oxford, ENS de Lyon, specialising in probability, game theory, financial mathematics. Currently seeking new opportunities to leverage my background in maths, finance, economics, programming and drive impactful results in IT, finance, strategy. Throughout my career, I’ve demonstrated rigorous theoretical expertise, analytical skill, strategic insight as well as thorough experience in teamwork, project management, leadership, and am eager to continue growing professionally in a dynamic team environment. Open to roles in IT, finance, strategy.

<!--I am a mathematician (PhD) trained in stochastic analysis and control, game and decision theory, financial mathematics, and environmental economics. I have gained professional experience in both research and teaching through my position in the Stochastics and Financial Mathematics group at Technische Universität (TU) Berlin, lastly under <a href="https://www3.math.tu-berlin.de/stoch/wp_bank/">Professor Dr. Peter Bank</a>. Backed by my academic experience at TU Berlin, University of Oxford, ENS de Lyon, and Uni Freiburg, I combine rigorous theoretical expertise with practical applications in finance, economics, and policy making. 
Experienced in team work, leadership, and management, I am interested in leveraging mathematics and game theory to understand and solve complex strategic problems and to support better decision making in economics, finance, and beyond.-->

I obtained the degree <em>Dr. rer. nat.</em> in Mathematics at Technische Universität Berlin and within the <a href="https://www3.math.tu-berlin.de/stoch/IRTG/">Berlin-Oxford International Research Training Group 2544 "Stochastic Analysis in Interaction"</a>, a certified unit of the <a href="https://www.math-berlin.de/">Berlin Mathematical School</a>, and advised by <a href="https://www.stochasticcontrol.org">Professor Dr. Christoph Knochenhauer</a>. Before this, I have studied in Oxford, Berlin, Lyon (ENS), and Freiburg, and obtained the degree <em>Master of Science</em> in Mathematics in Lyon.

The second main pillar of my academic activity has been <a href="/teaching">**teaching**</a>. I have taught mainly in courses on Probability Theory, Financial Mathematics, and Analysis, mostly for pure Mathematics programmes, but also for Business Mathematics and Engineering programmes.
