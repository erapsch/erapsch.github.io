## Summer term 2025

Currently, I work as an "Assistent" for the course "Analysis II für Ingenieurwissenschaften" at TU Berlin, for further information see the <a href="https://isis.tu-berlin.de/course/view.php?id=42635">ISIS webpage</a>. 

## Previous terms

Previously, after tutoring experience during my BSc studies in Freiburg, I have served as an "Assistent" (Germany-specific position) in several courses of the Mathematics and Business Mathematics BSc and MSc programmes at TU Berlin, under <a href="https://www3.math.tu-berlin.de/stoch/wp_bank/">Professor Dr. Peter Bank</a>, <a href="https://stochasticcontrol.org/">Professor Dr. Christoph Knochenhauer</a>, and <a href="https://www.wias-berlin.de/people/koenig/">Professor Dr. Wolfgang König</a>, namely:

1. Finanzmathematik / Financial Mathematics I: Martingales, no-arbitrage pricing theory in discrete time incl. first and second FTAP, incomplete markets, superreplication duality, American options and optimal stopping, portfolio optimisation, Brownian motion and Black-Scholes formula
2. Finanzmathematik / Financial Mathematics II: Continuous semimartingales, no-arbitrage pricing theory in continuous time, Brownian financial markets, volatility smile and non-trivial volatility models, term structure models, Merton problem
3. Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie / Probability Theory I: Basics of measure theory and functional analysis, elementary examples for probability measures, independence, weak/strong law of large numbers, weak convergence and central limit theorem (basic version)
4. Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie / Probability Theory II: Further measure theory and functional analysis, martingales in discrete time, Markov chains, ergodic theory, Brownian motion
5. Analysis I: Basics of logic and set theory, real and complex numbers, sequences and series, continuous functions and derivatives in one real variable, power series, Riemann/regulated integral

Moreover, I have served as an "Assistent" in Engineering programmes, <!--under <a href="https://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~mehl/">Professor Dr. Christian Mehl</a>, <a href="http://www.winkert.de/">Professor Dr. Patrick Winkert</a>, <a href="https://www.tu.berlin/math/research-assistants/franziska-borer">Dr. Franziska Borer</a>, <a href="https://www.tu.berlin/vcard/matthias.hammer/26766">Dr. Matthias Hammer</a>, <a href="https://www.tu.berlin/math/research-assistants/gabriele-penn-karras">Dr. Gabriele Penn-Karras</a>, and <a href="https://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~quellm/">Dr. Michael Quellmalz</a>, -->namely in the course:

1. Analysis II für Ingenieurwissenschaften / Analysis II for Engineering Sciences: Basic real analysis in finite-dimensional real coordinate space, including continuity, derivatives, integration, classical vector calculus in three-dimensional space

<!-- ## What is an "Assistent"?

"Assistent" (German) = person in charge of:

* structuring, preparing and conducting a course (called “Übung”), that both a) accompanies the main lecture by providing supplementary contents, in the form of propositions and examples, and b) serves as an exercise class (2) creating exercises including solutions and further remarks for tutorials (called “Tutorium”)
* conducting tutorials
* creating homework tasks including solutions (weekly)
* correcting homework submissions (weekly)
* creating examination tasks including solutions (twice per term)
* pre-correcting examination submissions (twice per term)
* assisting in oral examinations
* administration (website, IT, examinations, rooms)
* managing the communication between lecturer and tutors

Not all of these points may apply for all courses. There are course with both Übung and Tutorium, there are courses with only one of it. Some courses have oral, others written examinations.

SWS = Semesterwochenstunden = cum tempore hours of courses to be taught per term -->
