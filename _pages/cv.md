Here you can find a brief overview over my CV. A detailed CV is available upon request.

## Work experience

1. Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter: tasks in <a href="/research">research</a> in Stochastics and Financial Mathematics (50 %) and 4 SWS <a href="/teaching">teaching</a> (50 %), Group "Stochastik und Finanzmathematik", TU Berlin
2. Research Intern (3x): research tasks in Financial Mathematics (CREST, Paris) and Complex Geometry (Institut Fourier, Grenoble)
3. Tutor (3x), Universität Freiburg

I worked on a large range of topics in mathematics, with strong interest in the connection to economics and finance. This resulted in a roughly 250-pages monograph on Probability, Game, and Decision Theory. I have held about two dozens scientific presentations at international conferences, workshops, seminars, several of them on invitation. See <a href="/research">**research**</a> for more information.

I taught in pure and applied math programmes as well as in service courses for engineers, in small and huge formats. This included manifold organisational tasks, supervising of teaching assistants, preparing pedagogic material, and holding classes. See <a href="/teaching">**teaching**</a> for more information.

## Education

I studied Mathematics as a primary subject, and also, as secondary subjects, Economics, German Literature, History, and Physics, in Berlin (TU, HU), Oxford, Lyon (ENS), and Freiburg.

1. Dr. rer. nat. Mathematics, Technische Universität Berlin, University of Oxford 
2. MSc Mathematics, École normale supérieure de Lyon, Université Lyon 1
3. BSc Mathematics, Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg
